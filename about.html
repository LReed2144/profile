        <h1>General</h1>
          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer with back-end knowledge in
            JavascriptES6,PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails framework and implementing
            geocoding APIs. Front-end experience coding in JavaScript,
            React.js and Reduct, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Ajax, and Test Driven Development. My love
            for computer science and coding stems from my background in
            linguistics.
          </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            In 2019, I did a French-based coding bootcamp in Berlin, Germany called Le Wagon. The curriculum is 
            full-stack with backend languages in Ruby and Javascript and On Rails and React.js for libraries/framworks.
            The program also worked with frontend design using html, css, flexbox, grid, and figma for design.  The database 
            focus on was on mySQL. We built did coding problems, built webpages, and the culmination or cornerstone 
            project was building an app.<br/>
            After sucessfully completing this program, I came back to the U.S. and began a front-end certificate 
            program at Harvard Extension School. My goal is to complete both the front and back-end certificate 
            programs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University with
            an M.A. in Applied Linguistics. After graduating in 2015, I taught
            foreign language education which involved teaching undergraduate future teachers
            the pedagogy of teaching foreign languages.  Along with foreign language education,
            I also taught linguistics in universities and language institues in the
            U.S. and around the world for over 10 years. This involved
            technical areas in syntax, phonetics and phonology, pragmatics,
            semantics, sociolinguistics, second language acquisition,
            and macrolinguistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            My B.A. is in Philosophy and Applied Linguistics from Portland
            State University in Portland, Oregon. I also obtained a
            post baccalaureate in T.E.S.L. (Teaching English as a Second Language) from
            the same university.  With these degrees, I traveled and taught
            in public and private schools in Portland, Oregon,
            Amherst, Massachusetts, New York, New York, Tokyo, Japan,
            Bangkok, Thailand, Nablus, Palestine, Lisbon, Portugal,
            and Eskisehir, Turkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am self-directed, creative, and driven.  I immensely enjoy collaboration,
            travel, yoga, exercise, and dance.  In 2018, I became a Vinyasa yoga instructor, RYT 200.
            I am passionate about health and fitness
            both in body and mind. This experience has deepened my own practice
            and given me the opportunity to teach in both Turkey and New York City.
         </p>
          <p>
            In the past few years, I have expanded my passions to coding
            languages and software development. I have worked on many websites,
            projects, and apps. In 2019, I collaborated on a project
            involving raising social consciousness, specifically, through an app that deals
            with street harrassment in major cities. For more details scroll down
