        <h2>General</h2>
          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer with back-end knowledge in
            JavascriptES6, Ruby, Ruby on Rails framework and implementing
            geocoding APIs. Front-end experience coding in JavaScript,
            React.js and Reduct, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and Ajax. My love
            for computer science and coding stems from my background in
            linguistics.
          </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University with
            an M.A. in Applied Linguistics. After graduating in 2015, I taught
            foreign language education which invovled teaching undergraduate future teachers
            the pedagogy of teaching foreign languages.  Along with foreign language education,
            I also taught linguistics in universities and language institues in the
            U.S. and around the world for over 10 years. This involved
            technical areas in syntax, phonetics and phonology, pragmatics,
            semantics, sociolinguistics, second language acquisition,
            and macrolinguistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            My B.A. is in Philosophy and Applied Linguistics from Portland
            State University in Portland, Oregon. I also obtained a
            post baccalaureate in T.E.S.L. (Teaching English as a Second Language) from
            the same university.  With these degrees, I traveled and taught
            in public and private schools in Portland, Oregon,
            Amherst, Massachusetts, New York, New York, Tokyo, Japan,
            Bangkok, Thailand, Nablus, Palestine, Lisbon, Portugal,
            and Eskisehir, Turkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am self-directed, creative, and driven.  I immensely enjoy collaboration,
            travel, yoga, exercise, and dance.  In 2018, I became a Vinyasa yoga instructor, RYT 200.
            I am passionate about health and fitness
            both in body and mind. This experience has deepened my own practice
            and given me the opportunity to teach in both Turkey and New York City.
         </p>
          <p>
            In the past few years, I have expanded my passions to coding
            languages and software development. I have worked on many websites,
            projects, and apps. In 2019, I collaborated on a project
            involving raising social consciousness, specifically, through an app that deals
            with street harrassment in major cities. For more details scroll down
