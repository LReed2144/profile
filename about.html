          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer with back-end knowledge in
            JavascriptES6, PHP, Python, Django. Ruby, Ruby on Rails and implementing
            geocoding APIs. I have front-end experience coding in JavaScript,
            React.js, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and Test Driven Development. My love
            for computer science and coding stems from my background in
            linguistics.
          </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am doing a front-end graduate certificate in software engineering at Harvard University.
          In this program, I have built webpages with vanilla javascript, CSS and HTML, as well as, in Wordpress with Divi, wordpress database, and PHP. I have also built web apps
          in Python, Django, Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.  </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I did a French-based coding bootcamp in Berlin, Germany called Le Wagon. The curriculum is 
            full-stack with back-end languages in Ruby and Ruby On Rails, as well as JavascriptES6 and React.js.
            I also worked with front-end design using HTML, CSS, flexbox, grid, bootstrap and figma.  I gained working
            knowledge with mySQL and SQL.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University with
            an M.A. in Applied Linguistics. After graduating in 2015, I taught
            foreign language education which involved teaching undergraduate future teachers
            the pedagogy of teaching foreign languages.  Along with foreign language education,
            I also taught linguistics in universities and language institues in the
            U.S. and around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My B.A. is in Philosophy and Applied Linguistics from Portland
            State University in Portland, Oregon. I also obtained a
            post baccalaureate in T.E.S.L. (Teaching English as a Second Language) from
            the same university.  With these degrees, I traveled and taught
            in public and private education centers in Portland, Oregon,
            Amherst, Massachusetts, New York, New York, Tokyo, Japan,
            Bangkok, Thailand, Nablus, Palestine, Lisbon, Portugal,
            and Eskisehir, Turkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am self-directed, creative, and driven.  I immensely enjoy collaboration,
            travel, yoga, exercise, and dance.
          <p>
            In the past few years, I have expanded my passions to coding
            languages and software development. I have worked on many websites,
            projects, and apps. In 2019, I collaborated on a project
            involving raising social consciousness, specifically, through an app that deals
            with street harrassment in major cities. For more details check out my <a class="githublink" type="text/css" href="https://github.com/LReed2144">github.</a>
